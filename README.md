## How to Play

### Moving Around

To move around in this game, you have to press the arrow keys or wasd. The arrow keys and wasd will move the square or cursor on your screen. Moving the cursor will allow you to place building blocks in different areas. 
&nbsp

### Placing Bricks and Blocks

You can place bricks and blocks by pressing the space key on your keyboard. By default, you will place a black brick, but you can change that. Read the next section to know how.
&nbsp

### Changing Block Colors

You can change the color of a brick or block by pressing numbers 0-9. 1 is pink, 2 is firebrick, 3 is orange, 4 is gold, 5 is forest green, 6 is steel blue, 7 is dark slate blue, 8 is brown, 9 is black, and 0 is white. If you want to suggest more colors we can use, run the program and type no in the "need help" prompt. Then use [this website](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/color/named_colors.html) to find all the availible python color options.

## Bugs and Glitches

Here is a list of some bugs that are not fixed yet:

* You can glitch out of the boundaries and draw out of the boundaries
* If you hold space, the cursor might draw randomly or draw a line not supposed to be there.
